What happens when you initialize a repository?
  A .git repository is created that contains the necessary files to do version control on the parent directory. Remember, this doesn't do a commit. The user needs to do this

Why do you need to do it?
  This is the setup step so that the user can utilize the git shell commands for version control. A repository is created so that commits can add files/changes from the working directory to the repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
  The staging area doesn't contain the actual files like the directory and doesn't contain a a record of commits like the repository. Instead it is a temporary place where a user can specify the files whose changes he want commit to the repository
What value do you think it offers?
  It means that a user doesn't need to add all of the changes to the files in the directory to a commit. Instead a user can specify the exact file(s) he wants to commit changes. This contributes to employing the concept of one commit per logical change

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

How would branches help?
  Branches create allow users to create multiple versions of a project and maintain version history on them simultaneously
