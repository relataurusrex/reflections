When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  - When more than one person is contributing to the project
  - When you are using more than one machine to work on the project (keeping repos in sync)
  - Possibly if you machine is damage, safety

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  - You're working on a feature and don't want any new code that has been added to the remote to be automatically added
  - You would like to create a new branch with the code you have added and staying in sync would complicated this

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks: takes a GitHub repository on someone else's account and creates a copy on your account. Use this when you want to add/change code on another project in GitHub without changing the original repository
  Clones: Creates a copy of a GitHub or local repository and in a new repository. Use this when you want to work on a GitHub repository so you can modify the files locally
  Branches: Creates a different version of a project, allows a user to create a distinct commit history. Use when you want to experiment or create a different version of the code without affecting the master branch.
